# FNO
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for ice sheet modelling

This repository is an application of the FNO for ice sheet modelling and is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895 which develops the FNO. It implements the Bayesian inverse approach with preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate parameters of an ice stream model.
